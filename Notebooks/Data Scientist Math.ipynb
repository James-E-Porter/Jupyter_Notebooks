    "##### Correlation is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables. To calculate the correlation between two variables, you can use the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It is denoted by r, and is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = Σ(x - x̅)(y - y̅) / √[Σ(x - x̅)²Σ(y - y̅)²]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where x and y are the two variables, x̅ and y̅ are the means of the two variables, Σ is the sum of the values, and √ is the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation will give a value between -1 and 1. A value of -1 indicates a perfectly negative linear relationship, a value of 0 indicates no linear relationship, and a value of 1 indicates a perfectly positive linear relationship."
